## Application Overview

This project demonstrates a cloud-native two-tier web application consisting of a static frontend and a Python-based backend API.

The backend exposes REST APIs that provide application and runtime information, including:

- Application health status
- Application metadata (name, version, and environment)
- Runtime system information such as hostname, operating system, and Python version

The frontend provides a simple web interface that consumes these APIs and displays the information to the user.

The frontend and backend are deployed as independent Kubernetes workloads and communicate internally through Kubernetes Services.

The application is containerized using Docker, deployed to Amazon EKS using Helm charts, and exposed externally through an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB). A Jenkins CI/CD pipeline automates the build and deployment process, and k6 scripts are included for basic load testing.

Although the application functionality is intentionally simple, its primary purpose is to demonstrate modern cloud-native application deployment practices, including containerization, Kubernetes orchestration, Helm-based deployments, CI/CD automation, and application validation on Amazon EKS.

### Available API Endpoints

### Repository Organization

The repository is organized by responsibility to improve readability and maintainability.

- **Application Source** – Frontend and backend application code.
- **Containerization** – Dockerfiles for packaging the applications.
- **Deployment** – Helm charts for Kubernetes deployment.
- **CI/CD** – Jenkins pipeline for automated build and deployment.
- **Performance Testing** – k6 scripts for validating application performance.

This structure separates development, deployment, automation, and testing concerns, making the project easier to maintain and extend.

## Application Components

The application is built using a modular two-tier architecture, where each component has a specific responsibility.

---

### Frontend

The frontend is a lightweight static web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is served using NGINX and provides a user interface for interacting with the backend API.

**Responsibilities**

- Display the web interface
- Invoke backend REST APIs
- Present application and system information
- Run as an independent Kubernetes Deployment

---

### Backend

The backend is developed using FastAPI and exposes REST APIs that provide application health, metadata, and runtime system information.

Available APIs include:

- `/api/health` – Returns the application health status.
- `/api/info` – Returns application metadata such as application name, version, and environment.
- `/api/system` – Returns runtime information including hostname, operating system, and Python version.

The backend is deployed independently as a Kubernetes Deployment.

---

### Docker

Both the frontend and backend are containerized using Docker.

Separate Dockerfiles are maintained for each application component, allowing them to be built, versioned, and deployed independently.

---

### Helm Charts

The application is deployed using Helm charts.

Separate Helm charts are provided for:

- Frontend
- Backend API
- Kubernetes Ingress

Supporting Helm configurations are also included for:

- AWS Load Balancer Controller
- Metrics Server

This modular Helm structure simplifies application deployment, upgrades, and configuration management.

---

### Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline

A Jenkins pipeline automates the application deployment workflow by:

- Building Docker images
- Pushing images to the container registry
- Deploying the application to Amazon EKS using Helm

This enables repeatable and consistent deployments.

---

### Load Testing

The repository includes k6 scripts for basic performance testing.

These scripts simulate concurrent user requests and help validate application availability and responsiveness after deployment.

## Docker Configuration

The frontend and backend applications are containerized independently using Docker. Each component has its own Dockerfile, allowing them to be built, versioned, and deployed separately.

---

### Frontend Container

The frontend is packaged as a lightweight NGINX container that serves the static web application.

The Docker image includes:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- NGINX configuration

The container is responsible for serving the user interface and forwarding API requests to the backend service.

---

### Backend Container

The backend is built using FastAPI and packaged into a separate Docker image.

The Docker image includes:

- FastAPI application source code
- Python dependencies
- Application configuration

The backend exposes REST APIs that provide application health, metadata, and runtime system information.

---

### Image Build Process

Each application component is built independently using its respective Dockerfile.

Example commands:

```bash
# Build frontend image
docker build -t platform-frontend:latest ./frontend

# Build backend image
docker build -t platform-api:latest ./backend
```

The generated images are then pushed to a container registry as part of the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline before being deployed to Amazon EKS.

---

### Why Separate Docker Images?

Maintaining separate container images provides several benefits:

- Independent development and deployment
- Faster application updates
- Smaller container images
- Easier version management
- Improved scalability

For example, updates to the frontend can be deployed without rebuilding or redeploying the backend, and vice versa.

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses Jenkins to automate the complete application build, validation, deployment, and testing workflow on Amazon EKS.

The pipeline follows a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) approach, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistent deployments.

### Deployment Steps

1. A developer pushes application code to the Git repository.

2. Jenkins automatically starts the CI/CD pipeline.

3. The frontend and backend Docker images are built in parallel.

4. Trivy scans both container images for High and Critical vulnerabilities.

5. The validated Docker images are pushed to Docker Hub.

6. Helm validates the deployment configuration using linting and template rendering.

7. Required Kubernetes add-ons such as the Metrics Server and AWS Load Balancer Controller are installed or upgraded.

8. Helm deploys or upgrades the frontend, backend, and ingress resources on the Amazon EKS cluster.

9. The AWS Load Balancer Controller provisions an Application Load Balancer (ALB) for external access.

10. Jenkins performs smoke testing to verify that the application is healthy.

11. A k6 load test validates the application's availability and basic performance.

12. If any deployment stage fails, Jenkins automatically rolls back the Helm releases to the previous stable version.

---

### Deployment Outcome

After a successful deployment:

- The frontend application is accessible through the AWS Application Load Balancer.
- API requests are routed through Kubernetes Ingress to the FastAPI backend.
- Kubernetes manages application scaling, networking, and self-healing.
- Jenkins verifies that the deployment completed successfully before marking the pipeline as successful.

  ## Load Testing

The project uses **k6** to perform basic load testing after a successful deployment.

The load test validates that the application is accessible through the AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) and can handle concurrent requests.

---

### Objectives

The load test is used to:

- Verify application availability
- Validate API responsiveness
- Simulate concurrent user requests
- Detect deployment issues after release

---

### CI/CD Integration

The Jenkins pipeline automatically executes the k6 load test after:

- Docker images are built and pushed
- Helm deployment completes successfully
- Smoke testing confirms the application is healthy

This provides an additional layer of deployment validation before the pipeline is marked as successful.

---

### Running the Test Manually

```bash
k6 run --env BASE_URL=http://<ALB_HOSTNAME> k6/load.js
```

---

### Benefits

Using k6 provides several advantages:

- Automated post-deployment validation
- Performance verification
- Early detection of runtime issues
- Repeatable load testing

## Application Verification

After the application has been deployed successfully, the following commands can be used to verify that all components are running correctly.

---

### Verify Kubernetes Resources

Check that all application pods are running.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n <Namespace>
```

Expected output:

- Frontend pod in `Running` state
- Backend pod in `Running` state

---

### Verify Services

List the Kubernetes services.

```bash
kubectl get svc -n <Namespace>
```

Expected output:

- Frontend Service
- Backend Service

---

### Verify Ingress

Verify that the Kubernetes Ingress has been created and an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) has been provisioned.

```bash
kubectl get ingress -n <Namespace>
```

The output should display the ALB hostname under the **ADDRESS** column.

---

### Verify Application Health

Check the backend health endpoint.

```bash
curl http://<ALB_HOSTNAME>/api/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "status": "UP"
}
```

## Best Practices

The following best practices were followed while developing and deploying this project to improve maintainability, reliability, security, and deployment consistency.

---

### Containerization

- Build the frontend and backend as separate Docker images to enable independent development and deployment.
- Keep container images lightweight by including only the required dependencies.
- Use image versioning alongside the `latest` tag for better release management and traceability.
- Maintain Python dependencies in a dedicated `requirements.txt` file instead of installing packages individually in the Dockerfile.
- Copy `requirements.txt` into the Docker image before copying the application source code to leverage Docker layer caching and reduce image build time.
- Use `--no-cache-dir` during `pip install` to reduce the final Docker image size by avoiding unnecessary package cache files.

**Why use `requirements.txt`?**

Managing dependencies through `requirements.txt` provides several advantages:

- Ensures consistent dependency versions across development, testing, and production environments.
- Makes application builds reproducible and predictable.
- Simplifies dependency management by maintaining all Python packages in a single file.
- Improves Docker build performance by taking advantage of Docker layer caching. If only the application code changes and `requirements.txt` remains unchanged, Docker reuses the cached dependency installation layer instead of reinstalling all packages.
- Keeps the Dockerfile clean and easier to maintain.

---

### Kubernetes Deployment

- Package Kubernetes resources using Helm instead of maintaining raw Kubernetes manifests.
- Deploy the frontend, backend, and ingress as independent Helm releases for easier upgrades and rollbacks.
- Use Kubernetes Services for internal communication between application components.
- Expose the application externally using Kubernetes Ingress integrated with the AWS Load Balancer Controller.
- Deploy supporting Kubernetes components, such as the Metrics Server and AWS Load Balancer Controller, before deploying the application.

---

### CI/CD

- Automate the complete build and deployment workflow using Jenkins.
- Build frontend and backend Docker images in parallel to reduce pipeline execution time.
- Perform container image vulnerability scanning using Trivy before deployment.
- Validate Helm charts using `helm lint` and `helm template` before deploying to the cluster.
- Perform automated smoke testing after deployment to verify application availability.
- Execute k6 load testing to validate basic application performance.
- Automatically roll back Helm releases if deployment verification fails.
- Clean the Jenkins workspace after every pipeline execution to avoid leftover artifacts.

---

### Security

- Store Docker Hub credentials securely using Jenkins Credentials instead of hardcoding sensitive information.
- Scan container images for High and Critical vulnerabilities using Trivy before pushing them to the container registry.
- Avoid storing secrets, passwords, or API keys directly in the application source code or Docker images.

---

### Repository Organization

- Maintain separate repositories for infrastructure and application code to clearly separate responsibilities.
- Organize application source code, Helm charts, CI/CD pipeline definitions, and testing scripts into dedicated directories.
- Track all source code, deployment configurations, and automation scripts using Git version control.

---

### Validation and Testing

- Validate Helm charts before deployment to detect configuration issues early.
- Verify application health after deployment using dedicated health endpoints.
- Include automated smoke testing and load testing as part of the deployment pipeline.
- Validate Kubernetes resources after deployment using `kubectl` and Helm commands.
---

### Verify Application Information

Retrieve application metadata.

```bash
curl http://<ALB_HOSTNAME>/api/info
```

Expected response:

- Application name
- Version
- Environment

---

### Verify Runtime Information

Retrieve runtime system details.

```bash
curl http://<ALB_HOSTNAME>/api/system
```

Expected response includes:

- Hostname
- Operating system
- Python version

---

### Verify Helm Releases

Confirm that all Helm releases have been deployed successfully.

```bash
helm list -n <Namespace>
```

Expected releases:

- platform-api
- platform-frontend
- platform-ingress

---

## Known Limitations

This project was developed as a demonstration of deploying a cloud-native two-tier application on Amazon EKS using Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, and Jenkins. To keep the project focused and within practical constraints such as development time and cloud infrastructure costs, some production-grade features were intentionally kept out of scope.

The following limitations should be considered before using this project in a production environment.

---

### Project Scope and Time Constraints

The project was completed within a limited development timeline and is intended to demonstrate core cloud-native deployment practices rather than implement every enterprise feature.

The focus was on building a complete end-to-end deployment pipeline, including containerization, Kubernetes orchestration, CI/CD automation, security scanning, and deployment verification.

---

### Security Enhancements

To further strengthen container security and align with production best practices, the following improvements are planned:

- Run application containers as a non-root user instead of the default root user.
- Create a dedicated application user and group within the Docker image.
- Apply the principle of least privilege by granting only the required permissions.
- Continue using lightweight base images to minimize the attack surface.

---

### Single Environment Deployment

The application is deployed to a single Kubernetes environment.

A production implementation would typically include separate Development, QA, Staging, and Production environments with environment-specific configurations.

---

### Simplified CI/CD Pipeline

The Jenkins pipeline automates application build, validation, deployment, smoke testing, and load testing.

However, enterprise CI/CD capabilities such as the following were intentionally omitted:

- Manual approval gates before deployment
- Multi-environment promotion (Dev → QA → Staging → Production)
- Deployment notifications (Slack, Microsoft Teams, Email, etc.)

---

### Public Container Registry

Docker images are published to Docker Hub for simplicity and ease of demonstration.

In a production environment, organizations would typically use a private container registry such as:

- Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR)
- Harbor
- JFrog Artifactory
- Azure Container Registry (ACR)
- Google Artifact Registry (GAR)

to improve security, access control, and integration with enterprise CI/CD pipelines.

---

### Basic Security Implementation

The project performs container image vulnerability scanning using Trivy.

Additional enterprise security practices such as:

- Secrets management using AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault
- Pod Security Standards
- Kubernetes Network Policies
- Runtime security monitoring
- Image signing and verification

are outside the scope of this project.

---

### Limited Monitoring and Observability

The project validates deployments using smoke tests and k6 load testing.

A production implementation would also include:

- Centralized logging
- Distributed tracing
- Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- Alerting and monitoring dashboards

---

### Basic Application Functionality

The application exposes REST APIs for health checks, application metadata, and runtime system information.

The primary objective of the project is to demonstrate cloud-native deployment practices rather than implement complex business logic.

---

### Limited High Availability Configuration

The project relies on Kubernetes self-healing and deployment strategies.

Advanced production capabilities such as:

- Multi-region deployment
- Disaster recovery
- Cross-region failover
- Active-active or active-passive architectures

are not implemented.

---
### No Persistent Database

The application is intentionally designed without a persistent database to keep the project focused on demonstrating cloud-native deployment practices within the available development timeline.

Instead of implementing data persistence, the backend exposes APIs for health checks, application metadata, and runtime system information.

A production implementation would typically integrate a managed database service such as:

- Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL or MySQL)
- Amazon DynamoDB
- Amazon Aurora

along with database migrations, backup strategies, and secure credential management.

---

### Repository Organization

Currently, the Helm charts and configuration used to deploy cluster-level components such as the AWS Load Balancer Controller and Metrics Server are maintained within the application repository.

To keep the project focused and within the available development timeline, these components were not moved to the infrastructure repository.

As a future enhancement, these cluster-level components will be managed alongside the infrastructure code to provide a clearer separation of responsibilities:

- **Infrastructure Repository**
  - Amazon EKS infrastructure
  - AWS Load Balancer Controller
  - Metrics Server
  - Cluster-level add-ons

- **Application Repository**
  - Frontend application
  - Backend application
  - Application Helm charts
  - CI/CD pipeline
  - Load testing

This separation more closely aligns with production environments, where platform components are managed independently from application deployments.

  ## Prerequisites

Before building or deploying the application, ensure the following software and services are available.

### Required Software

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Git | Clone the repository |
| Docker | Build and run container images |
| Kubernetes CLI (kubectl) | Interact with the EKS cluster |
| Helm 3.x | Deploy Kubernetes resources |
| Jenkins | Execute the CI/CD pipeline |
| AWS CLI | Authenticate and interact with AWS services |
| k6 | Execute load tests |

---

### AWS Requirements

- AWS Account
- Amazon EKS Cluster
- IAM permissions for EKS deployment
- AWS Load Balancer Controller installed
- Metrics Server installed
- Docker Hub account (or another supported container registry)

---

### Backend Dependencies

The backend application is built using Python and manages its dependencies through `requirements.txt`.

Python packages are automatically installed during the Docker image build using:

```bash
pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```

This ensures consistent dependency versions across development, testing, and production environments.

---

### Frontend Dependencies

The frontend is a static web application built with:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- NGINX

No additional package manager (such as npm or yarn) is required.

## Running the Application

The application can be run either locally for development or on the Amazon EKS cluster after deployment.

---

### Run the Backend Locally

Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

Install the required Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the FastAPI application using Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The backend API will be available at:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

Useful endpoints:

```
http://localhost:8000/api/health
http://localhost:8000/api/info
http://localhost:8000/api/system
```

---

### Access the Application in Kubernetes

If the application is deployed on Amazon EKS but an external Load Balancer is not yet available, you can access the frontend or backend using Kubernetes port forwarding.

#### Frontend

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/platform-frontend 8080:80 -n platform-demo
```

Access:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

---

#### Backend

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/platform-api 8000:8000 -n platform-demo
```

Access:

```
http://localhost:8000/api/health
```

---

### Verify the Deployment

Check that all application pods are running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n platform-demo
```

List the services:

```bash
kubectl get svc -n platform-demo
```

View the ingress:

```bash
kubectl get ingress -n platform-demo
```
